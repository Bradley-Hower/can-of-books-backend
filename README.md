# Can of Books

**Author**: Bradley Hower
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
The purpose of this application is to act as a back-end server for the City Explorer project. https://github.com/Bradley-Hower/can-of-books-backend

This project will fully utilize a front-end, back-end, and database server.

This project demonstrates the use of a NoSQL database using MongoDB as the database program and Mongoose as the schema. 

Additionally, it will be a CRUD app, thus allowing for reading, creating, update and deleting of resources.

To start it off, the database will be populated with seed data.

## Getting Started

Node.js is needed.

`npm install`

To get the server started, Vite can be installed for ease of program, using `npm create vite@latest`. For this project, we will be using React and Javascript as the sub-options.

### Other Installations

+ React bootstrap - Front-end CSS framework `npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap`

+ Axios - HTTP client `npm install axios`

+ React Router - Web redirects `npm install react-router-dom`

+ Dotenv - Environment Variable Handler `npm install dotenv`

+ Express - Node.js RESTful web application framework `npm install express`

+ CORS - Domain safeguard `npm install cors`

+ Mongoose - Database Program `npm install mongoose`

**Whenever you want to test an iteration using vite as the server, in the terminal run `npm run dev`.**
